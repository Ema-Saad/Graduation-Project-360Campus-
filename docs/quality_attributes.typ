== Usability
== Performance

- Response Time: 
  The system should respond to user requests within 2 seconds for most operations, such as 
  logging in, fetching course materials, or submitting assignments. 
- Concurrent Users: 
  The system must support at least 100 concurrent users without a degradation in 
  performance. This is critical for peak usage times, such as during course registration or 
  exam periods. 
- Data Retrieval: 
  SQL queries for retrieving data (e.g., class materials, user profiles) should execute within 
  1 second. 
- Load Handling: 
  The system should handle increased loads gracefully, maintaining performance within 
  acceptable limits during periods of high activity (e.g., midterms or finals).
